/**
 * This adapter syncs with GoogleTasks API. Each sync is an incremental sync
 * from our last sync. This is accomplished with a combinatinon of etags and
 * last updated time stamp. The API returns a "global" e-tag (hash-value of all
 * content). If this is the same as the etag we have, then nothing has changed
 * on server. Hence, we can know that there is nothing to download. If the etag
 * has changed, the adapter requests, for all lists, all tasks which have been
 * updated since the latest synced task in the database.
 *
 * Before any changes are committed either way, we should have two DISJOINT
 * sets:
 *
 * TasksFromServer and TasksToServer.
 *
 * Due to the conflict resolution, no task should exist in both sets. We then
 * upload TasksToServer. For each upload the server will return the current
 * state of the task with some fields updated. These changes we want to save of
 * course, so we add them to TasksFromServer. Which means that after uploading
 * we have a single set:
 *
 * TasksFromServer
 *
 * Which now contains all tasks that were modified either locally or remotely.
 * In other words, this set is now the union of the two initially disjoint sets,
 * with some fields updated by the server.
 *
 * These tasks are then committed to the database in a single transaction.
